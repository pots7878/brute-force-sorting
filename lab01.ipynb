    "This lab introduces brute force algorithms. I implemented two sorting algorithms, selection sort and bubble sort, to sort a real one-dimensional array in ascending order. I then apply the selection sorting algorithm to a problem to determine the closest store location from a hypothetical caller's latitude and longitude location. The stores distance are calculated via the Haversine formula and the resulting list of stores, city, and distance are then sorted by distance in ascending order."

The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is  built up from left to right at the front of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right."
